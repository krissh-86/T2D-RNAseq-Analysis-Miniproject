T2D RNA-Seq Analysis Miniproject

This project investigates transcriptomic alterations associated with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) through comprehensive analysis of RNA-sequencing data from human pancreatic islet samples (GSE86468). Employing a robust bioinformatics pipeline in R, including DESeq2 for differential expression analysis, the study identifies key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked to T2DM pathophysiology. Functional enrichment analysis reveals critical pathways involved in insulin signaling, inflammatory responses, and maintenance of cellular structure. Notably, a predominant downregulation of genes related to cellular architecture suggests that T2DM impacts not only metabolic processes but also compromises cell integrity. Several DEGs emerge as promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets, offering valuable insights for precision medicine strategies tailored to molecular subtypes of diabetes.
